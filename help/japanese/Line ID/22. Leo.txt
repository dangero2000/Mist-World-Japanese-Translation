//Fusion Beast Mission
5331
Hey kid, you here to find a Fusion Beast too?

5333
There is one indeed, it's in the cave to the south. But it will be mine. Don't blame me for the competition. You're no match for the demons there. Just follow me and watch, kid.

5334
Pfft, a bunch of worms!

5335
Follow me.

5336
Haha, this is the place.

5337
Oh, This Fusion Beast sucks, it's slower than a turtle! Never mind, you can have this reptile. What a waste of my time.  Farewell, kid.


//3 Player Mission, follow the NPC and slay monsters 
5338
Need my help?

5339
I'm planning to go to the Sealed Land and kill a few super demons to stop them from attacking humans. This is a good place to warm up. So, do you need my help?

5340
Alright, let's go.

5341
There's a few demon makers ahead. All the demons here are created by these machines. I'll hold off the demons close to the machines, you find a way to shut them down.

5342
Tsk, disgusting.

5343
These machines are made by a man who calls himself the Demonist. Although they can only create weak monsters, they're still a threat to humanity after all.

5344
Tsk, it's over already? I didn't even brake a sweat. See ya.
