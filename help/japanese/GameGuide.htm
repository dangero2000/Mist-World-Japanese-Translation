<h3 id="section1">1 Game Introduction</h3><br>
Mist World is an 2D RPG MMO with top-down perspective.<br />
The entire game perspective is centered on you, and the four directions (up/north, down/south, left/west, right/east) are completely fixed.<br />
By simply pressing the direction keys, your character will move to that corresponding direction.<br />
Please note, although the four directions are fixed, when the character changes directions, he needs to turn to that direction before moving towards it, which means, the character follows the rules of the real world, unlike rudimentary 2D games where the character only moves with no concept of orientation.<br />
When the character turns, you will hear a light "swish" sound. The direction the character is facing affects the coverage of non-360 degree wide-range attack skills.<br />
For example, if you lock on to a monster in the west and cast an Ice Storm, all the other monsters in the west will also be affected by this wide-range attack skill, while monsters in other directions won't.<br />
The character's other actions also follow the laws of real-world physics.<br />
For example, when you press the W, S, A, D keys, if you only give it a short press, you will not hear the character's footsteps, unlike other games where pressing the cursor once will generate footsteps. At the same time, the character occupies a complete coordinate, unlike other games where the character only takes up a square as his coordinate. In our game, the character has an outline, and his body takes up each coordinate.<br />
For example, when you stand still and move one leg slightly forward within a one-meter square instead of taking a big step, you certainly won't hear any footsteps.<br />
You will only hear footsteps when you've moved across a real coordinate, which may feel a bit awkward if you're new to Mist World and have gotten used to other games. But when the character actually starts running, you will find that he is very flexible, and can move in eight directions.<br />
When the character casts a skill, you will find that he cannot move at the moment the skill is cast. This is a very common recovery setting in games.<br />
Many games have cast recovery and hit recovery settings.<br />
For example, you're running on the battlefield with a heavy weapon, when you attack an enemy, you need to swing the weapon, and at that moment, your movement speed is bound to be affected.<br />
The recovery setting is an important part in terms of the balance between melee and long-range classes.<br />
If no recovery is needed when casting skills, long-range classes can just hit-and-run when fighting melee classes.<br />
Monster attacks follow the same rule.<br />
When fighting monsters, you will find that because of cast recovery, the monster approach and attack you. In fact, the reason isn't cast recovery, instead, it's because monsters move faster than usual when chasing their targets. We've added a certain amount of intelligence to our monsters.<br />
If you provoked a beast, it would surely rush to you, instead of walking slowly.<br />
To avoid being quickly approached by monsters, long-range classes can swap the hotkeys of follow attack and stationary attack in the settings menu by pressing F1.<br />
Please tap the skill key instead of long-pressing it to cast the skill while running.<br />
The game introduces the concept of common skill CD. Common skill CD time vary by classes. This determines how often the character can cast basic skills. For example, in melee classes, Assassin has the shortest base attack interval, followed by Warrior, while Orc has the slowest attack speed.<br />
Most skills use the common skill CD, which means, after you've cast a skill, you need to wait for the common skill CD to cast the next skill, even if they're not the same.<br />
Common skill CD is also an important part of ensuring balance. If there's no common skill CD, a character can cast multiple skills in a short period, which will greatly damage the game's balance.<br />
Killing other players is strictly restricted in the game. Please click on Morality in the character panel to view its introduction.<br />
/p>
<p>
<h3 id="section2">2 How do I Choose My Class</h3><br />
There are 8 classes in the game, divided into 16 male and female characters.<br />
Each account can create a total of 8 characters. If you want to discard a created character, you can delete it in the character list after 10 days without logging into it.<br />
Character gender cannot be changed after creation is complete.<br />
Warrior: great attack continuity, depends heavily on the ability to adapt to the different circumstances, average defense, all-rounder tank.<br />
Orc: steady and reliable, extremely high physical defense, physical tank.<br />
Assassin: high burst damage, extremely high magic defense, magic tank.<br />
Hunter: long-range physical attack support, great survivability.<br />
Mage: long-range magic attack support, good at control.<br />
Elf:  long-range magic attack assist, burst damage.<br />
Priest: All-rounder healer, focused on direct healing and group healing, useful at both offensive and defensive.<br />
Witcher: Various healing methods, great offensive ability.<br />
The characteristics, strengths and weaknesses of each class are also greatly affected by your performance. The above summary is for reference only.<br />
</p>
<p>
<h3 id="section3">3 What should I do as a New Player</h3><br />
New players of the Mist World will be introduced to the guide for new players. Please follow the voice guidance step by step. It will help you fully understand the game's hotkeys, control schemes, etc.<br />
Once you've completed the guide for new players, you will arrive at the start area. Please listen carefully to what the NPC has to say, or interact with them on your own to obtain clues to various missions and dungeons.<br />
Plenty of gameplay description, control techniques and Boss's traits are hidden in NPC dialogs.<br />
The start area has only one exit to the first monster area, and once you're out of the start area, there's a bigger world waiting for you to explore.<br />
Before you leave the start area, it is essential to learn all the skills below Level 15, and obtain all the novice equipments. This will greatly improve your combat strength, so you won't feel helpless after you leave.<br />
</p>
<p>
<h3 id="section4">4 What are Talents. How do I Activate Them</h3><br />
FAQ: What are Talents?<br />
A: Talents are a kind of passive skill that enhances the character's attributes and abilities.<br />
There are two main categories of Talents.<br />
The first is General Talents, which can provide the character with the ability to resist special terrain damage. Such as Anti-Corrosion, Turtle Breath, etc.<br />
The second is Class Talents, which can increase the attributes of different classes and provide them with exclusive skill effects.<br />
FAQ: How do I activate Talents?<br />
A: When you learn a Talent, you need to activate it to activate its effect. Next, we will use Corrosion Spell to explain how to activate Talents.<br />
In the start area, there's a mission where we need to eliminate all the rats in the granary. But the rats have polluted the place, and anyone who enters will suffer corrosion and die shortly.<br />
However, if you learned Anti-Corrosion, you will be immune to this corrosion damage.<br />
First, head to the Chalet northeast of the village to find Master Arthur, talk to him, select Learn Talents in the dialog menu and press ENTER to enter the interface.<br />
Now, select Anti-Corrosion, press Enter. An "are you sure you want to learn this skill" prompt will pop up, select YES and press ENTER, then you will hear a sound indicating you've learned the skill.<br />
Now, you will find the Anti-Corrosion skill in the skill section of your backpack. Press G, and you will see that the skill is not activated.<br />
To activate it, you need enough Talent Points and Arnebia.<br />
So, now, you need to talk to Master Arthur again, select Cultivate Talent Point and press ENTER to enter the interface.<br />
Here, you can see how many Talent Points can the current NPC help you cultivate, how many Talent Points you already have, and the cost for this cultivation.<br />
Select "Start Cultivation" and press ENTER, then you will hear a sound indicating you've learned the skill, and finally a voice saying that the Cultivation has completed.<br />
Anti-Corrosion requires 5 Talent Points to be activated, which means you need to Cultivate Talent Point five times with Master Arthur.<br />
When you have the required Talent Points, you can interact with the assistant next to the Master to activate the Anti-Corrosion skill. Speak with the assistant to bring up the "Reset Talents" interface.<br />
Here you can view all the Talents you've learned, such as the Anti-Corrosion we just learned. If you select the Anti-Corrosion skill, you will hear a voice saying "Anti-Corrosion; Requires 5 Talent Points; disabled". This means that this skill is not currently activated. Press ENTER to select it, and then scroll down, you will hear the price required to activate Talent Points. If you have enough Arnebia, continue to scroll down, select "Submit" and press ENTER, then you will hear a sound indicating you've reset your Talents.<br />
If you have insufficient Talent Points or Arnebia, you cannot reset Talents, and you will hear the corresponding voice prompt when submitting.<br />
Subsequent Talents will be taught by the corresponding NPCs. Usually, Talents can be activated at important locations, such as the City Lord's Mansion, the Palace, and parliament hall, etc.<br />
Talents cannot be forgotten after learning, but you can choose which ones to activate and not activate when resetting Talents, which is very important after learning Class Talents in the future. Players should activate Talents according to their own needs and the number of talent points they have.<br />
</p>
<p>
<h3 id="section5">5 What are Profession Skills. How do I Choose My Profession Skill</h5><br />
FAQ: What are Profession Skills?<br />
A: Profession Skills are a type of skills that provide support in the character's daily activities. There are three main categories.<br />
The first is Corpse Harvesting skills, including Draw Blood, Skinning, Cut Flesh, which can be used on monster corpses to obtain its blood, pelt and jerky respectively. These items can be used to craft medicines and food. You can only learn one Corpse Harvesting skill.<br />
Blood can be used to craft Red Potions that replenish HP; Pelts can be used to craft Blue Potions that replenish SP/MP; Jerky can be used to craft foods that slowly restore HP over a long period of time.<br />
Learning Corpse Harvesting skills will save you a lot of money for future supplies.<br />
The second is Production & Collection skills, including Mining, Fishing and Collect Herbs. These skills can only be used in designated locations, such as Mining Area, Lake and Herbal Garden. Similarly, you can only learn one Production & Collection skill. Production & Collection is an important source of Arnebia.<br />
The third is the unique Profession Skills of different professions. Including the Husband and Wife's Snuggle, and the tutor and pupil's Blood Transfusion. These skills are automatically acquired when the character has a spouse or pupil.<br />
FAQ: How should I choose Profession Skills?<br />
A: Corpse Harvesting skills are chosen according to the daily consumption of your Class. Production & Collection skills are chosen according to the Gang Production Area of your Gang (you need to join a Gang first).<br />
For example, Melee Classes consume a lot of Red Potions, so Draw Blood is the best choice for them.<br />
Healing Classes can heal HP by themselves, but they consume a lot of MP, so Skinning is the best choice for them.<br />
As for Hunters, Mages, and Elves, they should chose the skill according to their usual gameplay.<br />
If you're a solo player, then you probably need more Red Potions. If you have a team, then you might only consume Blue Potion as you have healers.<br />
As your character level up, food will become more important as they will be more effective when you have higher HP. However, food can only be crafted, so learning to craft food and sell them will be an important source of gold coins.<br />
When you don't belong to any Gang, it is okay to learn any of the Production & Collection skills as they have the same benefits.<br />
But if you intend to join a Gang, then you should chose the Production & Collection skill according to the Gang's Gang Production Area.<br />

<h3 id="section9">9 Pet In-Depth Introduction</h3><br />
<h4>[1: Pet Personality]</h4><br />
Pet Personality determines the behavior of the pet when following the character to fight monsters. Pets with different personalities are suitable for different Classes.<br />
Cautious: quick attack monsters that are not locked on them; change the target along with the player.<br />
Rely on the player to withstand attack, recommended for melee classes.<br />
Loyal: quick attack monsters that are attacking the player; change the target along with the player.<br />
Rely on the player to withstand attack. Recommended for melee classes. Loyal pets have almost the same functions as cautious pets, the only difference is that cautious pets have a wider range of quick attacks (they quick attack all monsters not attacking them, while loyal pets only quick attack monsters attacking the player).<br />
In other words, players with loyal pets require more demanding gaming techniques, and need to be able to withstand more damage as tanks in team fights.<br />
For example, when several players are fighting a boss together, Warrior A is taking damage, while Warrior B is assisting with attacks. If Warrior B is using a cautious pet, it can quick attack; but if he is using a loyal pet, it cannot quick attack.<br />
Smart: quick attack monsters that are targeting them, and will not change target until the monster is slain.<br />
Able to withstand attack themselves. The best choice when players need to split up with their pets to fight monsters; great for fighting small monsters.<br />
Smart pets can be used as tanks, but players need to beware when smart pets fail to attract the monster's attention, in which case, they will stop quick attack, and it is harder for them to attract the monster's attention again than courageous pets. Healing Classes are recommended to used smart pets as tanks, especially pets that attack high-defense targets.<br />
Courageous: quick attack monsters that are attacking the player and will not change target until the monster is slain.<br />
Able to withstand attack themselves. The best tank companions as they concentrate their attack with the player together.<br />
The drawback is they are not suitable to attack monsters separately with the player, in which case they cannot quick attack. Also, they cannot change their target at will. The bigger drawback is their defense tend to go overboard. They either have high physical defense and low magic defense, or have low physical defense and high magic defense.<br />
The above is the general choice for pet personality.<br />
In practice, melee class can also choose a tank pet, which may bring unexpected results;<br />
As a long-range class, if you are well-equipped, you can also choose aggressive pets and withstand attacks yourself. That way, your pet will be safer.<br />
A variety of pet soul stones will be dropped in the later game, and players can explore the fun of pairing with pets of different personalities.<br />
<h4>[2:Pet Rebirth]</h4><br />
1. Pet Rebirth can regenerate the five pet assets: Strength, Physique, Spirit, Resolve, Agility. You can stop the process when your pet has good assets.<br />
2. The functions of the five pet assets are:<br />
Strength increases attack and defense break chance<br />
Physique increases hit chance and critical damage<br />
Spirit increases critical hit chance and defense break damage<br />
Resolve increases toughness and critical hit resistance<br />
Agility increases dodge chance and defense<br />
3. In addition, the pet's overall assets grant damage bonus and damage resistance, the higher the assets, the better the effect.<br />
4.Every player has two free Pet Rebirths per day, and any additional attempts will require a certain amount of diamonds.<br />
5. When undergoing Pet Rebirth, the pet will add 1-2 Rebirth Points, which will be accumulated in a weak. At 24:00 every Sunday, half of the Rebirth Points will be merged into the pet's Foundation, and the rest will be cleared.<br />
6. The sum of Foundation and Rebirth Points is the pet's Breakthrough Index. After the Breakthrough Index is increased, the pet has a chance to mutate into a Mutant Pet when undergoing Pet Rebirth, and will have higher assets. The higher the Breakthrough Index, the greater the chance of pet mutation when undergoing Pet Rebirth. When the Breakthrough Index reaches maximum level, pet mutation has a 100% chance to happen.<br />
7. When the pet mutates, its Foundation and Rebirth Points will be reset.<br />
8. There are five levels of pet mutations: primary mutation, intermediate mutation, advanced mutation, super mutation and perfect mutation. The higher the mutation level, the smaller the chance of another mutation.<br />
<h4>[3:What places are pets not allowed? ]</h4><br />
General adventure dungeons and level dungeons don't allow pets to enter.<br />
These dungeons are designed to test the players' game techniques and cooperation, allowing players to bring pets will make these dungeons meaningless and boring. So when entering these dungeons, your pet will be put back to your inventory temporarily, and will be released once you've completed the dungeon.<br />
In addition, pets are not allowed in competitions. Players should win through skill and cooperation.<br />
The above are the places that don't allow pets to enter. They only take up over an hour per day in terms of gameplay. The time is even shorter if you don't play competitions.<br />
Except for the above, players can bring pets when exploring maps, doing missions, slaying monsters in monster area, fighting bosses, and playing experience dungeons, etc. In the majority of the game, pets will be your amazing companion in combat.<br />
【4: The difference between a blessed pet and an ordinary pet】<br />
In the previous public beta, some players compared blessed pets to other pets (such as beetles) at level 30, and felt that their stats were similar, so why are blessed pets be put on sale in the mall? What's so special about them?<br />
This is related to pet's potential. Pets with higher potential will gain more stats when leveling up. Blessed pets have high potential and can be used throughout the entire game.<br />
For players who want to keep the same pet that always has good stats, blessed pets are a good choice.<br />
Ordinary pets need to be replaced, generally once every other generation. Good ordinary pets have similar basic stats as blessed pets when they have the same level. It an ordinary pet is summoned with a particular high-quality soul stone, it may even have higher stats than blessed pets.<br />
So, if you don't want to purchase blessed pet, ordinary pets are also very useful in the game.<br />
The only downside is ordinary pets will have lower stats compared to blessed pets after a period of time, and needs to be replaced and trained again. For blessed pets, their foundation, mutation level and Talents can all be accumulated, thus opening up the gap with ordinary pets. This is the biggest advantage of blessed pets.<br />
<h4>[5: How to choose a blessed pet]</h4><br />
The Blessed pet soul stone have been adjusted. Now, you can choose from any of the four pet personalities when summoning pets with a soul stone. So, players don't need to consider the pet's personality when purchasing the soul stone.<br />
Instead, you need to think about whether you want a physical-attack pet or magic-attack pet.<br />
When fighting monsters, the two have little difference. Generally, monster's physical defense is slightly higher than magic defense, which corresponds to the attack stats of the pet.<br />
The main difference is that when fighting against the player, it is more advantageous for physical-attack pets to fight Mages, Elves and other players with low physical defense, while magic pets are suitable for classes with low magic defenses such as Orcs and Hunters.<br />
Goblins are the only kind of physical-attack pets; magic-attack pets include Sprites, Pixies, and Slime.<br />
Secondly, you need to choose your favorite pet voice. There's a few recordings in the file folder for reference.<br />
</p>
<p>
<h3 id="section10">10 What are Fusion Beasts</h3><br />
Fusion Beasts in the Mist World are inspired by anime and other games. You can simply think of them as mounts, but they are fundamentally different.<br />
Traditionally, characters can ride mounts to gain speed boosts or attribute bonuses, while Fusion Beasts can allow the character to transform himself and obtain their characteristics, such as mammoths in beast form, werewolves in Demi-human form, and iron beetles in insectoid form.<br />
Apart from the complete transformation, Fusion Beast allows players to semi-transform, and can float above the player's head to follow him closely.<br />
There are two types of Fusion Beasts: Swift and Fierce.<br />
Swift Fusion Beast will greatly increase the character's movement speed, up to twice as fast as before the transformation. But players cannot use skills when transformed.<br />
Fierce Fusion Beasts increase the character's movement speed, as well as their attributes, making them stronger in combat.<br />
Fusion power will be consumed when you transform. It is the second value you hear when pressing T.<br />
Players cannot transform when fusion power is less than 10. Transformation will be lifted when fusion power drops to 0. Fusion power will gradually recover when not transformed. So players should choose the right time to use their Fusion Beasts.<br />

<h3 id="section11">11 What are the Benefits of Becoming a Tutor</h3><br />
When your character reaches Level 60, you can take in pupils and team up with them to play in the tutor and pupil dungeon every day. A tutor can bring different pupils to the tutor and pupil dungeon repeatedly.<br />
Upon completion of the tutor and pupil dungeon, the pupil will receive Mentorship Points. When the graduates, the Mentorship Points will be transferred to the tutor.<br />
Mentorship Points can exchanged for gang contribution.<br />
As a tutor have more pupils, he can obtain better tutor titles. Please click on "Mentorship Points" in the character panel to view the Mentor Achievement Instruction.<br />

<h3 id="section12">12 Marriage In-Depth Introduction</h3><br />
<h4>[1: What are the benefits of getting married? ]</h4><br />
Characters that have reached Level 30 can get married.<br />
After marriage, the couple can give each other equipments.<br />
They will also receive wedding rings that increase attributes. Weddings of different specifications will reward you with different wedding rings.<br />
The couple will also automatically learn the Snuggle Skill, which can slowly restore their HP.<br />
In addition, the couple can hold float parades and grand weddings, which will give you and your friends rich rewards. Weddings of different specifications will have different tiers of reward value.<br />
The wedding will attract everyone's attention, and there will be a lot of interactive activities before and during the wedding. If you want to express your love, this is a good opportunity.<br />
In the whole marriage system, the wedding is the most lively and meaningful part.<br />
Couples can also play the couple dungeon to receive experience and item rewards after completion.<br />
<h4>[2: What is the process of marriage? ]</h4><br />
After the couple have registered their marriage with priest Michelle, they can first invite their friends to Central Plains to wait for the wedding float parade.<br />
After the couple has applied for the float parade with priest Michelle, they will depart from the church and take the parade along the streets of Giant Rock City. During the parade, gift packages will drop from around the floats for every participant to collect.<br />
There are gongs and drums on the floats, which can be hit by clicking on the floats. By doing so, you can create a more immersive atmosphere, and let the left-behind participants hear the location of the floats.<br />
The float will disappear after taking the couple back to the church, at which time, the couple can find priest Michelle to hold the formal wedding ceremony.<br />
Talk to priest Michelle, choose the theme of the hall where the wedding is to be held, press ENTER, and the couple will come to the wedding site first to prepare.<br />
Enter the hall and walk north, talk to the usherette on the way, they will give their blessings. Then, head to the stage on the northernmost side, on which the emcee is waiting for the couple.<br />
Talk to the emcee, and he will inform that you can invite your friends to the wedding. Then, look around the stage to find the messenger. Talk with him to invite your friends.<br />
Invitation methods include: ID invitation, Gang invitation, city invitation. You can use different invitation methods multiple times to invite friends, as long as the number of people invited to the hall doesn't exceed the maximum limit of wedding guests.<br />
Friends who received the invitation will see a prompt asking whether to accept the invitation. After clicking ACCEPT, they will be teleported to the wedding site.<br />
At the wedding site, the couple is protected by the Mist Gods, and will have invincibility. So there is no need to worry about the guests making too much of a racket.<br />
After all the guests have arrived, the couple can interact with the honor guards on both sides of the hall to light the large fireworks, which will drop all kinds of gifts for everyone to collect.<br />
Also, the guests can ask for small fireworks from the honor guards, which will also drop gifts when lighted up.<br />
After the fireworks display, the couple can find the emcee to start the formal ceremony. After the wedding has begun, guests will not be able to ask for small fireworks from the honor guards.<br />
When the emcee begins to host the ceremony, he will ask the newlyweds to collect vow cards and deliver their vows of love to each other. At this time, the groom will do so first.<br />
After the groom has delivered his vow, the bride will do so as well.<br />
If it is a grand royal wedding, at this time, there will be envoys from three countries to deliver their gifts. Every envoy has two gifts, one for the bride and one for the groom, so don't miss out.<br />
After that, the guests can collect blessing cards from the usherette, and give the newlyweds their blessings. the more blessings the newlyweds receive, the more gold coins they can get after the wedding is over.<br />
After the blessing session, comes the lively "Piggy Rush" session, where the newlyweds can release pigs in three times for everyone to chase and hit. Please note that the pigs can be released three times, so don't miss out.<br />
The pigs are very fast, and will run around the venue. But as long as you've participated, you will be rewarded after the pigs are knocked out. It is easier with more participants.<br />
For melee classes, if you can't chase up with the pigs, don't worry. Find a right spot, and give the pig a smacking when it comes your way.<br />
After the "Piggy Rush" session, comes the gift box session. The newlyweds can talk to the emcee to let gift boxed drop from random places in the hall. This session is designed to thank the guests, so the newlyweds cannot open any of the gift boxes dropped in the hall.<br />
You can interact with the emcee to check the total amount of gift boxes, how many have been dropped, and how many are left. Don't miss any of gift boxes.<br />
After the gift box session is over, comes the "Express Your Love" session, where the new couple will snuggle 100 times in front of the guests. The couple can use the Snuggle Skill by standing closely together (the two cannot be apart, even just a bit).<br />
After the "Express Your Love" session is over, the wedding will enter the final phase. At the time, please follow the emcee's guidance and talk with the priest to accept the blessing. Both the couple will receive Intimacy, and can collect gold coins from the priest. The number of gold coins is closely related to the number of blessings you've received before from guests.<br />
At this time, guests can collect gifts from the usherette, afterwards they will be teleported out of the hall automatically. The couple can leave the hall in the menu by pressing CTRL+ENTER.<br />
That concludes the entire wedding process.<br />
