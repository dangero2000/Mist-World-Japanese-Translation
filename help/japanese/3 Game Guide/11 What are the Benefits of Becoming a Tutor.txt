When your character reaches Level 60, you can take in pupils and team up with them to play in the tutor and pupil dungeon every day. A tutor can bring different pupils to the tutor and pupil dungeon repeatedly.
Upon completion of the tutor and pupil dungeon, the pupil will receive Mentorship Points. When the graduates, the Mentorship Points will be transferred to the tutor.
Mentorship Points can exchanged for gang contribution.
As a tutor have more pupils, he can obtain better tutor titles. Please click on "Mentorship Points" in the character panel to view the Mentor Achievement Instruction.
