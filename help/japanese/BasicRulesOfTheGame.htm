<h3 id="section1">1 Experience Calculation Rules</h3><br />
<h4>Experience Gaining—Solo</h4><br />
1. When fighting a monster of the same level, you will gain standard experience.<br />
2. When fighting a monster Level 1-4 higher, you will gain 104%, 108%, 112%, 116% of standard experience respectively.<br />
3. When fighting a monster Level 5 higher and above, you will gain 120% of standard experience.<br />
4. When fighting a monster of lower level, you will gain 4% less standard experience for each lower level.<br />
5. When fighting a monster Level 25 lower and below, you will gain no experience.<br />
<h4>Experience Gaining—Team</h4><br />
1. When players of similar levels team up to fight monsters, they will enjoy an experience bonus. There is a 10% experience bonus for every additional player in the team.<br />
For example, there is a Level 30 monster that is worth 100 experience:<br />
If it is slain by a Level 30 player, the player will gain 100 experience;<br />
If it is slain by two Level 30 players, there is 110 experience in total, and each of the players will gain 55 experience;<br />
If it is slain by three Level 30 players, there is 120 experience in total, and each of the players will gain 40 experience; and so on.<br />
2. When players with large level gaps team up to fight monsters, the total experience gained will be less, and it will be tilted towards the higher level players. The specifics will not be detailed here, players can find out in the game.<br />
3. Players who can gain experience: All the team members within 40 yards of the slain monster.<br />
</p>
<p>
<h3 id="section2">2 Experience and Loot Distribution Rules</h3><br />
1. When no one tries to kill-steal, the player who dealt the killing bow to the monster will receive the experience and loot;<br />
2. When there are multiple players trying to kill-steal, the player with the highest Threat in the monster's hostile list will receive the experience and loot;<br />
3. If a team of players defeated the monster, the experience and loot will be distributed to all team members within 40 yards of the monster. In which, loot will be randomly distributed, and the experience will be distributed according to the Experience Calculation Rules.<br />
4. As for loot, players need to fight monsters at least level 9 lower than themselves on the public map to have 100% loot drop rate. For example, if the player is Level 40, he needs to slay monsters that are Level 31 and above to ensure he gets loot.<br />
5. On the public map, if the monster is level 10-19 lower than the player, the loot drop rate will become 50%. For example, if the player is Level 40, when he slays monsters that are Level 21-30, he will only have a 50% chance to receive loot;<br />
6. On the public map, if the monster is level 20-29 lower than the player, the loot drop rate will become 25%. For example, if the player is Level 40, when he slays monsters that are Level 11-20, he will only have a 25% chance to receive loot;<br />
7. On the public map, if the monster is level 30 and lower than the player, it will not drop any loot when slain.<br />
8. Most of the monsters on dungeon maps follow the same rules, and some may have different rules. Players are encouraged to explore on their own.<br />

<h3 id="section3">3 Morality Rules</h3><br />
Morality<br />
1. Morality is a value that shows whether a player is friendly to other players. When a player has high Morality, it means that he is friendly to other players and will not take the initiative to attack others; When a player has low Morality, it means that he is aggressive and will kill other player characters.<br />
2. The player's initial Morality is 0. The highest is 2000, and the lowest is -2000. The color of the player's name changes according to their Morality.<br />
3. Players with Morality between -500 and 500 have gray names. When you kill a gray-name player, you lose 50 Morality.<br />
4. Players with Morality between 500 and 1000 have green names. Green-name players will be marked green on the map. When you kill a green-name player, you lose 100 Morality.<br />
5. Players with Morality no less than 1000 have white names. White-name players will be marked white on the map. When killed, they lose less experience than gray-name and green-name players, and can spend 500 Morality to enter mist god Valley. When you kill a white-name player, you lose 150 Morality.<br />
6. Players with Morality between -500 and -1000 have red names. Red-name players will be marked red on the map. When killed by other players, they have a chance to lose items, in which case, the player who killed them will receive half of those items.<br />
7. Players with Morality no more than -1000 have black names. Black-name players will be marked red on the map. When killed by other players, they have a chance to lose items, in which case, the player who killed them will receive half of those items. In addition, Whenever black-name players are killed by monsters or other players, the equipment they're wearing has a 20% chance of being wrecked. Black-name players will also be subject to other restrictions. It is tough to survive in the game with a black name, the only advantage is that they can enter the black domain.<br />
8. In addition to the above color names, when a gray-name, green-name or white-name player takes the initiative to attack another gray-name, green-name or white-name player, the attacked player will see the attacker as a yellow-name, and can kill the attacker without losing any Morality.<br />
9. The above changes of Morality is effective on most maps, except for certain protection maps, competition maps and practice maps.<br />
10. Morality increases automatically when you slay monsters or haven't killed any player for a while. When a player hasn't killed any other player for more than 8 hours, his Morality increase 1 point every 10 minutes. When a player is slaying monsters on a public map, his Morality increase 5 points every 10 minutes.<br />

<h3 id="section4">4 Buff and Debuff Skill Rules</h3><br />
There are two types of (de)buff skills: self buff skills, and non-self (de)buff skills that can be cast to others.<br />
Self buff skills is completely independent. When cast, they cannot be dispelled by dispel skills or replaced by other supporting skills. They will only disappear after the duration ends.<br />
Self buff skills include: 1. movement speed increase—Warrior's Wind Step, Orc's Haste, etc.; 2. Critical Hit increase—Assassin's Leap Gouge, Elf's Scorch, etc.; 3. Accuracy increase—Hunter's Bull's Eye, etc.; 4. attack speed increase—Mage's Cold Winter, etc.; 5. invincible block and reduce mana cost to zero—Priest's Soul of Redemption; 6. Reduce damage taken and prevent interruptions—Witcher's Undying Resolve, etc; as well as many other buff skills.<br />
Non-self (de)buff skills can be dispelled by dispel skills, and can be excluded, replaced, or enhanced by other supporting skills.<br />
Among then, debuff skills that decreases physical defense include: Warrior's Armor Break, Orc's Giant Strike, Assassin's Puncture, etc. These skill effects can be stacked with other skills that are cast afterwards, up to 20% physical defense decrease. In practice, to maximize the physical defense decrease debuff, the debuff skills need to be cast in succession (the next debuff skill must be cast before the effect of the previous one ends).<br />
Debuff skills that decrease toughness include: Witcher's Corrosion Spell, etc. These skill effects can be stacked with other skills that are cast afterwards, up to 40% toughness decrease. In practice, to maximize the toughness decrease debuff, the debuff skills need to be cast in succession (the next debuff skill must be cast before the effect of the previous one ends).<br />
Except for the above two, the rest of non-self (de)buff skills adopts a replacement rule, which means, for skills with the same debuff effect, if you cast two skills subsequently, the latter one will replace the former one's effect.<br />
For example, Warrior's Battle Cry and Hunter's Strong-Arm Aura can both increase ally attack damage, and only one can be effective at the same time. If players use Strong-Arm Aura, then don't use Battle Cry until the buff disappears, otherwise the former's stronger buff will be replaced by the latter's weaker buff.<br />
All non-self (de)buff skills can be dispelled by dispel skills. But there are three types of debuffs: magic debuff, curse debuff and poison debuff, which all require the corresponding dispel skills to dispel.<br />

<h3 id="section5">5 Control Skill Rules</h3><br />
<h4>1. Types of Control Skill</h4><br />
Control skills can affect a character's actions. They include the following control effects:<br />
1. Stun: Stunned characters cannot attack, move, use items, dodge attacks, or wake up when taken damage.<br />
2. Restrain & Ensnare: Restrained or Ensnared characters cannot attack, use items, or dodge attacks.<br />
3. Knock-Out & Freeze: Knock-Outed or Frozen characters cannot attack, move, use items, or dodge attacks, but will wake up when taken damage.<br />
4. Transfix & Fire-Trap: Transfixed or Fire-Trapped characters cannot move.<br />
5. Silence: Silenced characters cannot cast channeling spells.<br />
As opposed to Control Skills, there are Counter-Control Skills. There are two types of such skills: decontrol and control immune. However, there are not many Counter-Control skills, players are encouraged to explore on their own.<br />
<h4>2. Control Overload Rules</h4><br />
Control Skills adopt to the Control Overload Rules, which means, when a character is affected by too many Control Skills of the same type in a short period, he will be immune to that type of Control Skills for 15 seconds.<br />
The specific rules are: If a player is affected by a type of control skill, and is affected again by the same type within 15 seconds after the first effect ends, he will accumulate an "Affected Time" of that type. If the player is affected a third time by the same type within 15 seconds after the second effect ends, then he will accumulate more "Affected Time", and so on. When the "Affected Time" reaches or exceeds 15 seconds, the player will be immune to that type of Control Skills for 15 seconds.<br />
The "Affected Time" only resets when a player is not affected again by the same type of Control Skill within 15 seconds after the first effect ends.<br />
<h4>3. Control-Immune Characters</h4><br />
In the game, some monsters are completely immune to Control Skills, mostly boss-level monsters. In addition, certain unique monsters have control-immune, including city guards, etc.<br />

<h3 id="section6">6 Threat Rules</h3><br />
1. Threat indicates the reaction of monsters to their enemy targets. Only Monsters have Threat;<br />
2. When a monster has Threat for one or more players, these values will be stored in the monster's Hostile list. Players can select the monster and press TAB to view the specific Hostile list;<br />
3. When players attack the monster, they will generate Threat according to the damage dealt. Only a few skills that aim to increase Threat are exceptions.<br />
4. The attacked monster will spread Threat to its companions within a certain range. The affected monsters will also add the player to their Hostile list with 0 Threat.<br />
5. When Priest or Witchers heal players in the monster's hostile list, they will generate Threat equal to 70% of the healed HP;<br />
6. When the monster is not locked on to a certain player, it will attack the player with the highest Threat in its hostile list; When the monster is locked on to a certain player, if another player's Threat is no less than 115% of its target, it will change its target to the player with the highest Threat.<br />
7. When the highest Threat in the monster's hostile list exceeds 1/8 of its total HP, all Threat will be reduced to 70%;<br />
8. Melee Classes have certain skills, such as Taunt, that can force the monster to attack the caster, at which time, the Hostile List Rules are ignored.<br />
