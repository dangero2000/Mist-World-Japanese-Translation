## **Disclamer**

This translation is on GitHub to streamline the contribution process. I do not want to deal with the struggle of passing a ZIP file around to people who want to contribute, nor do I want to deal with file conflicts and issue reports on a case-by-case basis depending on which archive file someone might have. Git, and GitHub by extention, makes it easier to track issue reports and changes to the translation, as well as who forked it and what changes they made so that the new changes can be implemented up stream. Therefore, I decided to maintain this translation project here on GitHub.

There is something I need to make abundantly clear. Just because the Mist World Japanese translation is on GitHub does not mean the game itself is open sourced. The game is very much proprietary. I do not provide nor possess any reverse-engineered parts of the game, nor source code, nor any part of the game normal users were not meant to have access to. I will never honor requests for any reversed-engineered parts of the game, nor do I condone doing such a thing.

Anyone and everyone is allowed and even encouraged to make translations for the game by the developers. As far as I can tell, they do not have a terms of use document posted anywhere about where you are allowed to distribute your game translations. In fact, the only terms of use that I was able to locate discussed the music in the game and nothing else. However, should the game developers reach out to me, either via the issues page or my email address, stating they would like me to remove this project from my GitHub page, as well as provide me with sificiant proof that they are indeed the developers, I will have to immediately honor their request and remove this translation from my GitHub page. It is also worth mentioning that, should I be requested to take the page down and given no other Git-based or Git-like alternative that the developers would be more comfortable with me using, I will no longer maintain the Japanese translation of Mist World. While this is a passion project, it would not be worth maintaining if I had to go through the trouble of keeping track of it the old-fassioned way, passing around archive files on file sharing websites such as Dropbox. I would pass the project on to someone who would be more willing or able, or it would simply disappear.

## Introduction

Mist World is a Chinese MMO RPG audio game for the blind and visually impaired, and to date, it is arguably the biggest audio MMO RPG in existance. You can fight monsters, mine ore, pick hurbs, team up with other players to take on dungeons and destroy monsters, and even get married. Yes, you heard me correctly, and this is not a translation error. This is how massively expansive the world of Mist World is.

Mist World is translated more or less into 14 different languages, and unfortunately, Japanese is not one of them. This is a problem I wanted to fix for multiple reasons:

- Not many audio games are translated into Japanese, and given my affinity for the language, I believe it deserves more representation.
- Try as I might, I have never been able to locate any Japanese blind gamer communities. If this project gains traction and succeeds, this will be the first step in a multi-step process to start a community.

## Translation Structure

### Folder Structure

There are several folders in the root of this repository which you will need to copy:

- Config: Settings directory
 - This configuration uses the NVDA screen reader for its voice engine, as the built-in voice does not properly support Japanese.
- Help: Documentation directory
- Language: Contains the Japanese string translations
- Sound: Contains the Japanese audio translations (currently not implemented)

### Translation Syntax

This section is currently empty. It will take time to write, and I wanted to get this translation into the public quickly so that people can begin using it.

## Known Issues

This translation was made with heavy assistance from Chat GPT. As such, the translation is fairly ruff and inconsistant. There will almost certainly be syntax errors in different parts of the translation, as well as missing strings.

I am not a native Japanese speaker, nor would I consider myself fluent. While I can fix consistancy, missing strings, and syntax errors, I will not be able to solve more complex problems such as grammatical structure or improper Kanji. Issue and pull request submitions are not only welcome, but encouraged.
